ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Katha Naik, a Computer Science major at Arizona State University (Barrett Honors) with a minor in Data Science. Iâ€™m deeply curious about the ways technology, design, and data intersect to solve real-world problems. From exploring machine learning and AI ethics to building accessible software and scalable systems, I love working on challenges that make an impact. âœ¨

I'm always learning whether through research, hackathons, or late-night coding sessions. Outside the screen, youâ€™ll probably find me capturing life through a camera lens ðŸ“¸, playing the ukulele ðŸŽ¶, or hunting down the best dumplings in town ðŸ¥Ÿ.

Letâ€™s build something meaningful together ðŸš€
